What make me passionable. For one year in canada, I tried to find out the answers about those question. Now, I found out my next step.
<br><br><br>I want to start my introduction with this story.<p>
In our lives, everybody has a special person who gives strong motivation. For me, the person is Michael Jackson. Ever since a kid, I was fascinated by his music and performance. He always tried to express his message in his music. He communicated with people around the world through music and gave a positive effect on their lives including me. Due to Michael Jackson’s inspiration, I also wanted to become an inspirational person who can affect people’s life. I want to express my message in myworks and communicate globally.
